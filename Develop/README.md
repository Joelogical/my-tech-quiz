# Tech Quiz Testing Project

Welcome to my Tech Quiz Testing Project! I've implemented comprehensive testing for a Tech Quiz application using Cypress, ensuring the application's reliability and functionality.

## Project Overview

I've enhanced a working Tech Quiz application by implementing thorough testing. The application features:

- Interactive quiz interface
- 10 random questions per session
- Score tracking
- New quiz functionality

## Testing Implementation

I've developed two types of tests to ensure application quality:

1. Component Tests: Individual component validation
2. End-to-End Tests: Complete user flow verification

The test suite validates:

- Start button functionality
- Question display and navigation
- Answer submission
- Score calculation
- New quiz initialization
- Error handling and display

## Setup and Execution

1. Server Setup:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

2. Client Setup:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Test Execution:

```bash
npm run test:open
```

## Technical Achievements

- Implemented Cypress testing framework
- Developed robust component testing
- Created comprehensive end-to-end tests
- Implemented error handling scenarios
- Achieved full test coverage of user flows

## Video Demo

[Coming soon! Video demonstration of test execution and application functionality]
